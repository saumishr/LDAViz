DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  ""A Maze of Death"" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  ""VALIS"" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  ""The Divine Invasion"" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it ""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  ""The Bible"" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  ""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  ""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  ""What is atheism?""  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong atheism"".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  ""But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  ""What is agnosticism then?""  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only when referring to ""strong atheism"".  Beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  ""So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  ""But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  ""But what if God is essentially non-detectable?""  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  ""OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?""  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""the redefinition game"".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""Isn't atheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by ""religious"".  ""Religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   ""religion"" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of ""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  ""OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?""  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called ""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  ""If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or ""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be ""anti-religion"".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of ""state atheism"" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  ""But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?""  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  ""What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?""  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  ""You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?""  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""I do not believe in God"" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""Today is not my birthday"".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  ""You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  ""How do atheists differ from religious people?""  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  ""Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable (""wrong"") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    ""Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.""  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [""Freethought Today"", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  ""Is there such a thing as atheist morality?""  If you mean ""Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean ""Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  ""Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?""  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  ""But don't atheists want to believe in God?""  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the ""Big Brother"" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  ""But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!""  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as ""Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  ""Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thing that has a ""meaning"".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking ""What is the meaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?"".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  ""So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  ""Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""  The short answer is ""No, do you?""  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  ""So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?""  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  ""What sort of harm?""  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  ""Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.""  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  ""Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, ""weak"" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  ""Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct"" it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  ""But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?""  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  ""What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?""  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  ""So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?""  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  ""Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?""  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself.

Well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see, to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is, we shall be moral unto what end?  >>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but   also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability   to commit the same crimes again.

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?    Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond   that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life   at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are   tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.   /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"

While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.      Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities. The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker side.  --Andre  --               Andre Yew andrey@cco.caltech.edu (131.215.139.2)"

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.  The Phillips rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the commercial release date.  By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies designing titles for the box will be over 300.  How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters last week.

My problem is,  I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try: 	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM 	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print 	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript 	lpr			# print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use: 	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it 	is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a 	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide. 	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and 	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified 	paper width.  	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, 	but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.

The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of all, EMX is free.  :-)  There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with Windows, as far as I know.  >7. price          $120          $70         $120     free-$1000s >                                                     A good one >                                                     costs $400-$700  >                                                     avaliable on Ext. >                                                     card too.

Using Amish Launch as your shell, you can reduce GDI memory usage by as much as 15% over Progman, NDW 2, DAshboard, and other graphical type icon based and other shells.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.  > You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like. > ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality > and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.  Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.   > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503 > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525 > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209  Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup.  It's like it's trying to it's bit in wearing the damn drive out.  I estimate it's only reading a Mb of programs & data, but from the performance the drive gives, it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive (my drive is however regularily compressed).

Thanks.     A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the  msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it  best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible,  however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard  driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available  on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning  of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you  wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report  the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.  How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???  Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed? Save up for a *really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...  Thanks! --  =============================================================================== What engineers say:     Extensive effort is being applied on a fresh approach to the problem.

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen  gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4"" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't  been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story... So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.  Jude M. Greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu  P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom. "

My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)   					John   --  John Gayman, WA3WBU  UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH "

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.  I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.  I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware, and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).  If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable setting and switch automatically?

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.  Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.

After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu  PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program. X X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from X    a short example!

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y"" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.

[LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) + X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n. X                obfuscatory adj. X  X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X  X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access  X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may  X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at; X  X        judges@toad.com   -or-   ...!{sun,uunet,utzoo,pyramid}!hoptoad!judges X  X    Previous contest winners are available via anonymous ftp from X    ftp.uu.net under the directory /pub/ioccc.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options 	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. 	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will 	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 	is listed below.  	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was 	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). 	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. 	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, 	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you 	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). 	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link 	2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two        headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports: 	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC 	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1  	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active 	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.  	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, 	but anyone should feel free to submit patches. 	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to 	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:  	Tseng ET4000 	Tseng ET3000 	Paradise PVGA1 	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of 		the PVGA1, and use its driver) 	Genoa GVGA 	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 	ATI 18800, 28800  	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, 	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 	256 color mode.  	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of 	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the 	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome 	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.  	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to 	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To 	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel 	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how 	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such 	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with 	future XFree86 releases.  	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, 	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the 	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not 	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. 	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond 	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions 	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). 	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.  	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA 	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the 	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It 	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset 	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot 	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested 	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not 	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 	working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?  	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards 	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available 	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).  	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact 	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.  	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> 	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?  	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory 	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- 	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each 	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- 	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled 	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code 	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). 	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer 	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, 	but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?  	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run 	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. 	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending 	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). 	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will 	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  	lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?  	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: 		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) 		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) 	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)  	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information 	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?  	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries 			under /XFree86/SVR4 		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/ISC 		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries 			under /pub/linux/packages/X11 		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries 			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries 			under /i386  	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may 	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will 	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take 	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were 	made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories  	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot 	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include 	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.  	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified 	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is 	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed 	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files  	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup. 	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in 	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes  	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known 	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. 	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and 	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is 	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on 	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated 	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the 	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to 	David for inclusion in the database.  	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. 	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use 	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information 	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.  	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and 	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot 	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from 	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The 	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. 	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your 	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up 	      starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit  	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to 	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is 	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?  	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4 	Why won't my xterm run properly?  	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define 	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. 	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'  	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping 	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be 	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.  	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey 	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the 	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:  	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux  	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc 	jump libraries installed.  	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.  	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to 	run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes 	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files 	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the 	-pn argument to X386.  	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major 	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not 	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit 	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but 	startx won't.  	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with 	a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".  	For more detailed information, please read the file README present 	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?  	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is 	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. 	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library  	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. 	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a 	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), 	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include 	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro 	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are 	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these 	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS  	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the 	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite 	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see 	something like 		CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put 		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of 		ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi"" 		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: 		ANSICCOPTIONS= 	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death 	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because 	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must 	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

Xt Glossary ----------------------------------------------------------------------  o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code   to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with   this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,   RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.          Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To compile:  *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To run:  *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct { 	Visual	*visual; 	int	depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec	Options;  XtResource resources[] = { 	{""visual"", ""Visual"", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL}, 	{""depth"", ""Depth"", XtRInt, sizeof (int), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { 	{""-visual"", ""*visual"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}, 	{""-depth"", ""*depth"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv) 	int		argc; 	char		**argv; { 	XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ 	Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ 	Display		*dpy;		/* display */ 	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ 	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ 	Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ 	XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ 	XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ 	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ 	Arg		args[10]; 	Cardinal	cnt; 	char		*name = ""test""; 	char		*class = ""Test"";  	/* 	 * save the command line arguments 	 */  	xargc = argc; 	xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); 	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));  	/* 	 * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can 	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. 	 */ 	cnt = 0; 	top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, 			       (String *) NULL, args, cnt); 	dpy = XtDisplay (top); 	cnt = 0; 	XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources, 				   XtNumber (resources), 				   args, cnt); 	cnt = 0; 	if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) 	{ 		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * Now we create an appropriate colormap.  We could 		 * use a default colormap based on the class of the 		 * visual; we could examine some property on the 		 * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could 		 * do all sorts of things... 		 */ 		colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy, 					    RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)), 					    Options.visual, 					    AllocNone); 		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt;  		/* 		 * Now find some information about the visual. 		 */ 		vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); 		vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count); 		if (vinfo_list && count > 0) 		{ 			XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth); 			++cnt; 			XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); 		} 	} 	XtDestroyWidget (top);   	/* 	 * Now create the real toplevel widget. 	 */ 	XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt; 	XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt; 	top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class, 				applicationShellWidgetClass, 				dpy, args, cnt);  	/* 	 * Display the application and loop handling all events. 	 */ 	XtRealizeWidget (top); 	XtAppMainLoop (app); 	return (0); }  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5.  Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):   	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top;  		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	}  	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel;  		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		exit (0); 	}  One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.  	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>  	extern Widget ToplevelGet ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw 	#endif 	);  	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		XtPointer	closure 	#endif 	);  	extern void ExitCallback ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw, 		XtPointer	closure, 		XtPointer	call_data 	#endif 	);  	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top;  		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	}   	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel;  		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw), 				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL); 	}  	Boolean 	ExitWorkProc (closure) 		XtPointer	closure; 	{ 		exit (0); 		/*NOTREACHED*/ 	}   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OS's it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".  It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In particular:  	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while 	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other 	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race 	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.  	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.  	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as 	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing 	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it 	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at 	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks 	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having 	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had 	  been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this point I don't know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The 	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification"", Digital Press, 	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by 	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC 	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:  Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with 	Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). 	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource"" is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.

What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget sets:  Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most 	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is 	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on 	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but 	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think 	  it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets 	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by 	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality. 	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:  Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software 	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked 	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, 	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen 	  them so I can't comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of 	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor, 	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets 	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine 	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the 	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for 	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so 	  widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but 	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written 	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. 	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. 	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was 	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided 	  much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you 	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*  The following specialized widgets are also available:  Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif 	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets). 	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	__________________________________________ 	Name		Language	Vendor 	__________________________________________ 	Xview		C		Sun 	OI		C++		ParcPlace 	Interviews	C++		Stanford 	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu 	__________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) 	typdef struct 	{	 	    String	name; 	    long	value; 	} Arg;  and the code: 	Arg	arg;  	XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)  expands to 	Arg	arg;  	arg.name = ""name""; 	arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \     } else { \         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource converters:      string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:  	Name		Value 	""True""		1 	""False""		0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:  typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *, 	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value:  typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro:      #define DONE(var, type) \       if (toVal->addr) \ 	{ \ 	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ 	    { \ 	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ 	      return False; \ 	    } \ 	  else \ 	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ 	{ \ 	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ 	  return False; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter:  void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter:  void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:      XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values     XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:  typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer, 	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution:      mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3 ways: 	1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays, 	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message, 	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message, 	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:  #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy) 	Display		*dpy; { 	destroyDisplay (dpy); 	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () { 	... 	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) 		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); 	XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):  	1. Args passed at creation time. 	2. Command line arguments. 	3. User's per host defaults file 	4. User's defaults file. 	5. User's per application default file. 	6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):  	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the 		application's class name. 	%T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the 		literal string ""app-defaults"" 	%C	customization resource (R5 only) 	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. 	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"") 	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"") 	%t	The territory part of the display's language string 	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string  Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)  	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm 	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,       for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this:  	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""  If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:  		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5) 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ 		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is   		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5) 		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5) 		<root>/%L/%N:\ 		<root>/%l/%N:\ 		<root>/%N:  <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says:   	""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the  	procedure is to be appended.""   you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)  > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to TRUE.  Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency"" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.  > Is this a problem with ""mwm"" or is there something > else which needs to be done?  You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.  > If the problem is ""mwm"", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified?   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You can't.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something like:  	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) 	if (!ptr) 	{ 		perror (""malloc in xyzzy()""); 		exit (1) 	} To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:  	if (!ptr) 		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); 	else 		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); 	++count;  to be written as:  	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string:  	  struct abc *xyzzy; 	  char	     *ptr; 	  char	     *str = ""abcdef"";  	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ 	  ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:  	 char	      *ptr;  	 ptr = XtMalloc (100); 	 /* ... */ 	 free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I'd recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).  	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into 	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These 	instructions check every memory read and write performed by 	the program under test and detect several types of access 	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past 	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts 	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including 	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies 	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory 	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel 	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly 	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program 	down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unix's and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging Environment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource ""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example:      example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &     example% xwininfo -tree 	     <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  It's a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this:  	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; 	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. 	or this: 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% gdb application 	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 	(gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events.  For example:  	... 	cnt = 0; 	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class, 				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc), 				   &argc, argv, 				   Fallback, args, cnt);  	XtAddTimeOut (...) 	XtAddWorkProc (...)  	XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway.  The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib. --  Pete Ware					ware@cis.ohio-state.edu CIS Dept, Ohio State University			w/ (614) 292-7318 228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave.			h/ (614) 538-0965 Columbus, OH 43210"

The rules and guidelines for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry  about these changes.  chongo <Landon Curt Noll> /\cc/\        chongo@toad.com Larry Bassel                            lab@sun.com  =-=  #!/bin/sh # This is a shell archive (shar 3.32) # made 04/05/1993 23:00 UTC by chongo@toad.com # Source directory /tmp # # existing files WILL be overwritten # # This shar contains: # length  mode       name # ------ ---------- ------------------------------------------ #   8971 -r--r--r-- rules #  25592 -r--r--r-- guidelines #  34482 -r--r--r-- mkentry.c #   6418 -r--r--r-- obfuscate.info # # ============= rules ============== echo ""x - extracting rules (Text)"" sed 's/^X//' << 'SHAR_EOF' > rules && X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Rules X XCopyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XNOTE: Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->	      | X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed. X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary X X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source X		cp prog.c special_src.c X		cc special_src.c -o special_name X X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build X		tail +4 build > special_build X		sh < special_build X X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y"" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.

X X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.

X X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork, X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award. X X    The judges will choose the winners of each category. X X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands.

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets back into my long pulldown menus?

If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?    $0.02, doug."

Whoa. Bad repair record).  And all of these cars are driven fairly hard.

In consumer reports it is ranked high in many catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars. Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).  A couple of things though: 1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this    car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's. 2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully    loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match    up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993    version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.  I guess my question is: Is this a good deal?  Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?  Thanks,  Carl Hoffman  P.S.

AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.  NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines, (so they are similair.)"

The earlier cars (pre  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having  chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes  that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting  the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.  *************************************************************************** *Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe.  *  MGA 1600 MkII                        * *RCG1597@zeus.tamu.edu            *  Rebuild (complete) to be finished ?? * *Texas A&M University             *                                       * *Keeper of the eternal octagon    *  `69 MGB Roadster                     * * a.k.a.

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is ""What is the DoD?"", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be ""How do I get a DoD number?"" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List (KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)  Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.  By now you're probably asking ""So who's the KotL already?"". Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie mailers""). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head.  ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************  Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).  ***********************************************************************  One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example:  0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM  (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)  Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------              ""Denizens of Doom"", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)        [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]  There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal  things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and   motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,   helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,  traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double  entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They  argue with each other and plan rides together.  The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,  although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each  other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world  and communicate with each other electronically via computer.  The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;   the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry  professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently,  rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for  the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per  month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent  posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred  to as the DoD.  The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of  parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer  enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""Denizen  of Doom.""  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of  the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of  course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.  The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules  appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the  List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been  almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and  Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany, Norway and Finland.  Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run  of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the  American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser --  selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a  few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500  to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs  in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.  As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go  riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of  DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's  ""Silicon Valley.""  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on  Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California  ""Joust.""  The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big  barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern  California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north,  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan  for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction  with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.  Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective  communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to  get together.  Long may they flame.   ""Live to Flame -- Flame to Live""	[centerbar]  This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do  anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as ""flames"";   issuing them is called ""flaming.""  Flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A  typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be  something like:  ""What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad  poseur!""  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding  ability and your cat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------            _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                    by John Sloan  DoD #0011  Periodically the question ""What is DoD?"" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as ""Why is the sky blue?"", ""If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations.   A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it ""The Denizen of Doom"". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed.   He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number.   Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members.   In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)!   Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell.   The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address.   The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep.   We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection:   Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!!   Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW      crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer      11 but what the heck.    Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.  Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at      least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!      Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a      Woosh-a-stream.  Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.  Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???  Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see      what they say, eh?   Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.  High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.  Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!  Terrible: B.T.???  Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.  Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.  Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway???   Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.  Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.  Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.  Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!  Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???  Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean       even Villy Ogle flamed me for that!   Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.  Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush!   Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?  Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?  Heritick: Nahhh.  Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.  Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?  Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!  Muck: What's a carbujector?  Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!  Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!  Dill: Well, where do we race?  Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't      ride!   Muck: No! No! Quiet!  Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.      They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!  High: My 9 too!  Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!  Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!  Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin!   Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like      I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting      it up on the ole ventral stand!    Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and      Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too!   Booster: I hate Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.  Booster: I love Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.  Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?  Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.  Muck: What about a Tridump?  Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?  Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?  Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?  Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.  Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.  Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.  And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!  Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!  Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.  Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.  More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.  Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.  With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn.  Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns.   Muck: Why??  Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.  Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.  Clean: No GOOD!  Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!  Clean: Inferior!  Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill...   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for?   Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,      WILHEM!   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW?   And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding      Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.   All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.  Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of ""The Yearning and Riderless"" with its ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the question of: ""To Helmet or Not to Helmet"" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------            Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video                  by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94   [Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.]   (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as ""Chuck"". I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.)   Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,  cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,  may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted  to live a man's life, [Music slowly builds in background]  riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys,  living the life of a Motorcyclist;  doing donuts and evading the police;  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;  eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,  	I Want to be      A Denizen!  [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.]   Chuck [Sings to the tune of ""The Lumberjack Song""]:  I'm a Denizen and I'm okay, I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay, He flames all night and he rides all day.  I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen...  I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t.  Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He's a Denizen...  I wear high heels And bright pink shorts,  full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley,  just like my dear mama.  [Chorus refrain]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Why you have to be killed.  Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.  Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?"" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie ""Top Gun"" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied:  ""That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""  And the rest is history.  A variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include:  Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes  Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                       The rec.moto.photo archive  First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.  Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.  Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive.  **********************************************************  Via ftp:  cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]  Via e-mail:  The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:  dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps  and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.  Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. --  Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner  **********************************************************  A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        Patches? What patches?  You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: ""I want!"", or ""That's sick!"", or perhaps ""That's sick! I want!""  Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no ""DoD store"" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says ""I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?"" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action.  Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand].  All ""profits"" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of ""Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World"", complete with a DoD pin.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.  ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT  I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day.  ""Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:  Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to  see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way, I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank  you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

Over $5500  [Arnie]                           Organized (?) Rides:  Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]  Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, ""Friend of yours, Steve?"".  ""Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!""  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.   --  Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.com Manes and Associates				   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o "

In fact, >it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.  I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.  >Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first; >about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with >the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score >tied, for another .22.

But what does >that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense >is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn't >pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not >even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say >they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game, >which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will >himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.  The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.      >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough. > >In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?  No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.         >Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What >you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who  >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >Does this make sense?   No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.                                                          Brian Smith"

Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).  	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. 	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.

I thought I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. ""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this division.""      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, ""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't afford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked and said: ""Well, maybe Davis will get decked once.""      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.      ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.""      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.

Distribution: usa Organization: Georgia Institute of Technology Lines: 39  Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the  offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year.  	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The  rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know.

Mario Lemieux is the explanation, IMHO.    >You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that >would make the playoffs is the reason.   Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.  >But I think the reason is Lemieux >had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and >Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play.   I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.  But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase  will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.    >Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87.   Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.   >They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  >true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing >this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team. >A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An >increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival >of Mario Lemieux is what did it.   You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.  > Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before >Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They >are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement >since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going >to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't >GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than >they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.  I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.    Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.  >I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power.    For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.  >But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)  Well, at least we are in full agreement here!  >This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't  So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>  >getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge >jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne. >They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because >they are winning.  Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils  were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!

Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was interviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.  This is good, IMO.  There's no sense in expanding if it only means more failing franchises are in the mold.  -Tom Galvin             galvint@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil "

According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.  >>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  >>true.

It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See ""What is DES?"")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  ""DISCLAIMER"")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...   You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is  probably key distribution."

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT'S NEW ---------- I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn't available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is ""http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html"".  This month's version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I've also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy  Enhanced Mail (PEM).  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the  four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: ""What is PEM?"")   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the  README file that this law not be violated:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping  distribute it.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See ""What is DES?"")   Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message  (See ""What is a fingerprint, like MD5?"") is encrypted with the  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information  also may be in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with  interoperability.  7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example,  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.   There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash  function will be used if this is accepted as true.  8)  What is PEM?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?   This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310,  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key  cryptography.   This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive  (available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are  compressed with a patented algorithm.)  11)  What about RSADSI/PKP?   RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S.  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:        Cryptographic Apparatus and Method       (""Diffie-Hellman"")............................... No. 4,200,770        Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (""Hellman-Merkle"").................... No. 4,218,582        Cryptographic Communications System and       Method (""RSA"")................................... No. 4,405,829        Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus       and Method (""Hellman-Pohlig"").................... No. 4,424,414   PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.)  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their  patents.   RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography.  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing  code.  RIPEM even won the ""Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992""  award.  12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  13)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be    compatible with anything other than itself.   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its    patents to ""make, use or sell"" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without    either a license or written permission.  (See: ""DISCLAIMER"")    (See: ""What about RSADSI/PKP?"")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program,  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to  liability concerns.  14)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  15)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft  Internet documents exist on the matter.  16)  What is TIS/PEM?   Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH)  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know  much more than that.  17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...   You may wish to check the companion post ""ripem-attacks"" which  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main ""weak area"" is  probably key distribution."

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people ""vouch for you"" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says ""OK, let's do that."" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.     Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will   make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware   of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography   can never be greater than the security of the people using it."

Here is some  information ""from the horse's mouth"".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) ""Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines""  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  ""7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.  When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify  the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two  alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk  pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved  degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the  vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter)  removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for  destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new  platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.  7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media""  [see DoD Computer Security Center, ""Department of Defense Magnetic  Remanence Security Guideline"", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY]  ------  This and many other interesting documents (many that are more  informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures  can be obtained (free) from:  Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,  >Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus >than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will >keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will >simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.  What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.

Can any crypto >implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not >available EVER be trusted?  After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can ""break"" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can ""break"" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography. We are damned lucky to have them.

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I do not believe that RSA would consent to such.    However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size.    It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.

The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 (as suggested  by Joe Weizenbaum) was invertible.  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated  this to me in May 1973.  I then asked an expert (who requested anonymity)  what I should use instead; the expert's suggestion was to treat the  8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm,  which is similar or identical to DES.  This method or something stronger  should take care of (a).  Issue (b) is discussed in comp.security.misc:  longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords are the common tactics.  tom_vanvleck@taligent.com"

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely ""abberant"".  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes."" ----"

Is there any real-world application >for Tesla coils today ? > >David Prutchi  First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors, transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????  GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!  If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century. (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.  The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit.  BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

For instance, my  486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do  AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.  The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may  have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.    33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus  operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus  interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.  -rdd  ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9   inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal  bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is  attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the  enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.  This will eventually cause death.  Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and  approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients  administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable  improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured  by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000  per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called ""the most  expensive disease in the world"".  NEED INFO: I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying  on netlanders to provide me with any additional information: **news, stories, reports **people you know with this disease **ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of    enough money to buy some, programs available to help with    costs. **Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER  Thanks so very much!

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like ""Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.""  >You wanted >to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a >thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,  More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.  >and now you want >all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal >hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal.  It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.    >You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to >get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself >to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other ""just in case"" measures >you think are necessary.  My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.  >But I for one am bothered by your continued >suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first >time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these >unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing >it naturally.  I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.  >I'm no Luddite. I've had a section. I'm planning a hospital birth >this time. But for heaven's sake, not everyone needs that!  But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration. --  Mark A.

On one hand you state that ""things have changed dramatically"" but, at the same time nothing you ""can think of has changed"".  Your girlfriend seems to want to see a counselor, but you don't.    I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's a very good environment to examine issues.    The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than you.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.

As I understand, these are all short term.  I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.    I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good  patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637 info hotline.  Best of Luck to you.  Steve Holland. gila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.edu"

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there.  --  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   = =  General Internal Medicine      |      ""...dammit, not a programmer!  = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-="

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.  euclid  >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      ""...dammit, not a programmer!  = >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >--  >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      ""...dammit, not a programmer!  = -- Euclid K.       standard disclaimers apply ""It is a bit ironic that we need the wave model [of light] to understand the propagation of light only through that part of the system where it leaves no trace.""  --Hudson & Nelson (_University_Physics_)"

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which     much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again     unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set     public policy, that's what your representatives are for.       WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].      To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to     pursue are:      A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel     Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG     Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good     article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch,     ""Showdown at Pad 39-B,"" by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November     1989 issue of *Ad Astra*. (Both magazines are published by pro-space     organizations, the Planetary Society and the National Space Society     respectively.)

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800;     Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)       IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year 	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year 	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical     Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).      _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.     Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team's medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE ""FACE ON MARS""      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission     specialist"".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.      Astronaut Candidate Program     ===========================      Basic Qualification Requirements     --------------------------------      Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to     submitting an application.      Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:      1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,     biological science, physical science or mathematics.

Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a     military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following     specific standards:  	 Distant visual acuity: 	      20/50 or better uncorrected 	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.  	 Blood pressure: 	      140/90 measured in sitting position.      4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.      Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, 	Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological 	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:  	NASA Johnson Space Center 	Astronaut Selection Office 	ATTN: AHX 	Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth 	100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST 	not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all 	references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're 	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail 	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the 	'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone 	will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: 	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals 	(use carriage returns).       INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS      I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't     a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each     posting.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve 	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources     as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.      GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to     gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.      Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.      Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;     discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid     capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to     space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and     selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from     gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,     or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.      SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and     Development of Space and other interested parties. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your     name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.      SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email     LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join.     Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.      Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which     carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him     to join the list.      As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate     'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list     address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION      In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group     sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the     individuals posting this information are performing a service for all     net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.      ACRONYMS 	Garrett Wollman (wollman@UVM.EDU) posts an acronym list around the 	first of each month.      ASTRO-FTP LIST 	Veikko Makela (veikko.makela@helsinki.fi) posts a monthly list of 	anonymous FTP servers containing astronomy and space related 	material to sci.space and sci.astro.

INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:  	send SPACE Index 	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and     ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu     in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).      Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).       NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)      pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by     the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status     reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions.

NASA SPACELINK      SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center     in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for     teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current     and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and     technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom     activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a     number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA     Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it     does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments     for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered     electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by     mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during     missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop     between the user and NASA.      SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs     useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images     from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00     while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII     along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate     ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of     $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue     alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for     $300.00.      Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic     media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion     non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may     not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more     expensive than those given.

The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job     opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of     ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and     describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and     non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate     schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing     to space policy.

HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON      Official names are decided by committees of the International     Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial     organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and     star maps describing where to find ""your"" star. These organizations have     absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they     assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be     able to see ""your"" star without binoculars or a telescope.

""Fusion as Electric Propulsion"", Robert W. Bussard, Journal of 	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion 	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the 	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values 	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are 	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust"" 	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system 	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local 	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer 	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a 	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows 	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in 	    Earth/moon space.

[This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version 	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion 	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch 	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in 	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising 	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the 	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim 	    Bowery]  	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by 	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion 	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron 	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times 	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma 	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds 	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities 	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and 	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm 	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure 	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically 	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power 	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens 	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the 	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages 	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I 	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob 	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently 	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one 	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather 	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the 	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid 	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:  	Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE 	archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the 	SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in 	the 1960s and 70s.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,     says:  	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is 	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower 	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) 	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a 	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other 	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort 	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of 	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining 	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target 	in second stage.""      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack 	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the 	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line 	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly 	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of 	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z 	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" 	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the 	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.      3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more 	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or 	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be 	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").      4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated 	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort 	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver 	complexity"").      5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio 	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio 	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").      6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a 	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is 	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east 	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity 	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: 	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. 	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its 	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""     [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll     maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first 	     craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was 	     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images 	     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were 	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil 	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 	      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's 	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished 	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in 	      1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions 	       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with 	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in 	       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. 	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe 	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending 	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before 	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles 	       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet 	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 	       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the 	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar 	       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. 		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of 		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian 	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on 	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in 	     March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased 	     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian 	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian 	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red 	     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander 	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to 	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. 	     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit 	     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest 	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 	       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did 	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week 	       before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:  	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km 	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km 	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) 	Period		: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1), etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.  EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one of the below, this is their job:  NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government. It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors also work for NASA.

JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California 	Institute of Technology, unlike the NASA centers above. This 	distinction is subtle but critical. JPL has different requirements 	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. For instance in 	the latter, an SF 171 is useless. Employees are Caltech employees, 	contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities. 	They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

Has returned     the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to     Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have     essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.       OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron     Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro     Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based     on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.      1993 Missions 	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus] 	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform 	    a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray 	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search 	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white 	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also 	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron 	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos 	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development 	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the 	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch 	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.  	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket] 	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.  	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01] 	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.  	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket] 	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.  	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS] 	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be 	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and 	    engineering experiments.

Andromeda Software, Inc. 	P.O. Box 605 	Amherst, NY 14226-0605       COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS      Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.  		     (1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km 	 g  p  f  n  	       (1/6)     S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface 					    e		      t 			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is 			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for 			      other bodies.  		(1/3.4)     S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,      p	  a   t							    t 			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U 			       a 			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average 			      rock on the continental shields.      C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km 			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).  							    (1/3.4)     K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U 			      nuclear test crater.  	      3		   2		       19     W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  ) 			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent 			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile 			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3 			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10			    10		     10^-8		10^9       1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6       0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3      assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT     equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.      References:      Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and     tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

INTERPRETING THE FITS IMAGE FORMAT      If you just need to examine FITS images, use the ppm package (see the     comp.graphics FAQ) to convert them to your preferred format. For more     information on the format and other software to read and write it, see     the sci.astro.fits FAQ.       SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)      The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software     systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.     Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis     software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites     possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix     source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license to  	E.

Convert parallax into distance using the     formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and     scale this by the distance.      Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog     (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25     parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on     ames.arc.nasa.gov).

If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

Is there a single Titan III on order?  The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt to market it.  They're basically happy with their government business and don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.  A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly.  They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so.  There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So was that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached orbit properly. --  All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry"

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): ""We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.""

When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.

It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, ""God Loves You.""  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16      However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:         The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12      Jesus said:         I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?       A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to  do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say ""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"",  I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay ""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord's presence.  So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?  John Murray"

Lines: 16 Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.  The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).

This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should never be satisfied. It does not imply that having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin. It does imply that I sin every day.  A perhaps simpler definition: Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments:  love God, love your neighbor, is a sin. Anything I do that is not from love is a sin.  The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.

The concept of a closed canon would >certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand, >an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.  There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and  ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  ""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.    Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his  lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an  apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.    So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it  Scripture.    >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with >knowledge?  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with  prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also  similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another take"" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.    Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.   Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a  bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the  Spirit, and use them according to His leading.  Link Hudson."

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?

Certainly, people who >received tainted blood are not to blame. But it just goes >to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle? > >In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. >There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ? >I don't know.  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.  What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.  On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.  In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.  In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.  Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.  Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.  Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.  When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver.  The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable"" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings.  -------  This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.  Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.  As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.  	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to  	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting 	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate 	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that 	contention. 	 	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very 	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories, 	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities 	are very different with very different demographic characteristics 	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in 	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white 	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be 	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back- 	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various 	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide. 	 	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law, 	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all 	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect 	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975- 	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth 	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM 	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving 	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that 	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding 	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that 	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day 	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without 	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen? 	 	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national 	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily 	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because 	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific 	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which 	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""? 	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite 	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide 	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as 	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado 	Springs. (Ref. 3) 	 	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or 	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in 	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending 	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is 	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry 	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in 	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of 	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun 	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number 	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns 	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns 	legally for protection, registration figures are 	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York 	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two, 	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population 	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver 	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City. 	 	The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun 	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity 	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own 	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a 	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is 	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement 	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking 	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide 	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in 	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in 	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail- 	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and 	Vancouver. 	 	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and 	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that 	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to 	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian 	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal 	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more 	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually 	the case. 	 	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain 	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the 	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of  	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a 	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number 	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making 	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest 	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences 	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns, 	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social 	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences, 	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention 	most factors related to crime control. 	 	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective 	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not 	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost 	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from 	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the 	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be 	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury 	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors 	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides 	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle 	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides 	involving firearms. 	 	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,"" 	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied 	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb 	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly 	handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly 	be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or 	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent 	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding 	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25 	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs, 	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while 	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure 	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,  	announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough. 	It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be 	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM. 	 	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC 	make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific 	breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating 	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying 	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight 	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about 	the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, 	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call 	for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside 	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize 	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America. 	 				REFERENCES  1.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)        Someone once wrote: ""Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is    suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.""       The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in    many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all    else is equal"" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.""       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

Message-ID: <1993Apr5.184700.28601@Csli.Stanford.EDU> Sender: cower@Csli.Stanford.EDU (Richard Cower) Organization: CSLI, Stanford University Distribution: usa Date: Mon, 5 Apr 1993 18:47:00 GMT Lines: 34   The ATF agent interviewed on ""Street Stories"" reported that the raid was ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was  coming. WHY?  I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even  suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda,  as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.   Important dates:  Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	     On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  on ""Street Stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get  ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". I believe this attack continued,  even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.  ...rich   "

To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore"" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   ""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.""   >Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:  Come again?  : ""These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to... >(34 lines deleted)  Why?  : No wonder you are in such a mess.

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** > 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of > the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel? First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town   on a rail.   					chag sameach! 						jeff"

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the  question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have  not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.     What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my    point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel     is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights     to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic     deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.  If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then  tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?     |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others     |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or     |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights.      |> Such as the right to live?

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because    any system can solve it.     The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine).   I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for  all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that  mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your  reply.     Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)     said it best when writing in his diary in 1940: 	   ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both 	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal 						^^^                  ^^^ 	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country. 	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of 	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than 	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to 	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be  	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to 	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out."" 				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967 				   (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)  Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to  getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to  a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to  make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get  something back.      ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which).      Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the     imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !     I think that is fair enough .  No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve  the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction. Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land.       ""The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children"". 			   -Rabbi Shoham.

He's setting himself up to be in hot water.  Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose.  Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return.  Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.  Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code.  --Tim Smith"

Some more details would be appreciated. |>  |> cheers  Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously. What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.  As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....  During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an ""economist"" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly ""supply side"" policy, since taxes do not ""cause""  economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be  explained by watching population waves roll through the years and  create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he is.  Paul Collacchi"

The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect    to join.  There are just so many.         Dean Kaflowitz  Yes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So convenient that it is burdensome at times.  Dave.    ============================================================= --There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.

A creationist appears on t.o, makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of which he/she is completely ignorant, is taken to task, and finally replies with a subtle insult. (actually two insults)  Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details. Jack, you don't know anything about abiogenesis, do you? (this is no sin, I know next to nothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this ""10^50""  probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.  The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_ do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school? Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know? Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basis upon which to imply that to keep an ""open mind"" one must allow that the earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created ~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say that you don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. I don't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the one calling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, where do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that all of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?  You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationism is a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especially speculative, in which case I have merely misinterpreted you. In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear prose.  >Jack  Scott smullins@ecn.purdue.edu"

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve. Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an ""argument from article length.""  And the list you have here is of poorer quality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from an on-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem with verses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.  I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none who denied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many of the contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls in one verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort of contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in my experience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount to anything more than attacking a straw man?  Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes out of context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the ones that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about them than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effort should be made to understand and respond to the common replies given by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that Dave Butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre. That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list that would have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documented contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out of context and thrown together in a list.)  Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to make a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us who want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.  dj  P.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in /pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The quality is very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just a compilation of things many people have written), but some of it would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, I might be willing to help put it together."

Well---*I* know of ....  Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong (and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of the departed.  Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.  Have you ever read or seen ""Alive"", which is the story of the Argentinian boys soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died in order to survive?
